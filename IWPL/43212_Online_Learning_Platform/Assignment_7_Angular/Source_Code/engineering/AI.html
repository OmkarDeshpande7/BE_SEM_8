          Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without
          being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has
          given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective
          web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome.
          Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens
          of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is
          the best way to make progress towards human-level AI.
