Standard EnglishFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to navigationJump to searchIn an English-speaking country, Standard English (SE) is the variety of English that has undergone substantial regularisation and is associated with formal schooling, language assessment, and official print publications, such as public service announcements and newspapers of record, etc.[1] It is local to nowhere: its grammatical and lexical components are no longer regionally marked, although many of them originated in different, non-adjacent dialects, and it has very little of the variation found in spoken or earlier written varieties of English.  According to Trudgill,[2] Standard English is a dialect pre-eminently used in writing that is largely distinguishable from other English dialects by means of its grammar.The term "Standard" refers to the regularisation of the grammar, spelling, usages of the language, and not to minimal desirability or interchangeability (e.g. a standard measure).[3] All linguistic features are relevant to standardisation, including morphology, phonology, syntax, lexicon, register, discourse markers, pragmatics, as well as written features such as spelling conventions, punctuation, capitalisation and abbreviation practices.There are substantial differences among the language varieties that countries of the Anglosphere identify as "standard English"; in England and Wales, the term Standard English identifies British English, the Received Pronunciation accent, and the grammar and vocabulary of United Kingdom Standard English (UKSE). In Scotland, the variety is Scottish Standard English; in the United States, the General American variety is the spoken standard; and in Australia, the standard English is General Australian.[4] Sociologically, as the standard language of the nation, Standard English is generally associated with education and sociolinguistic prestige, but is not inherently superior to other dialects of English used by an Anglophone society.[5]Contents1	Definitions2	Grammar3	The Origins of Standard English3.1	Present-day investigations into the origins of Standard English3.2	Before Standard English: Late West Saxon3.3	Before Standard English: mixed language3.4	Before Standard English: Middle English3.5	Before Standard English: the demise of Anglo-Norman3.6	Before Standard English: supralocal varieties of English4	From Supralocal Varities to Standard English5	Superseded explanations of English standardisation5.1	a.

The distinction among registers also exists between the spoken and the written forms of SE, which are characterised by degrees of formality; therefore, Standard English is distinct from formal English, because it features stylistic variations, ranging from casual to formal.[6] Furthermore, the usage codes of nonstandard dialects (vernacular language) are less stabilized than the codifications of Standard English, and thus more readily accept and integrate new vocabulary and grammatical forms. Functionally, the national varieties of SE are characterized by generally accepted rules, often grammars established by linguistic prescription in the 18th century.[7]English originated in England during the Anglo-Saxon period, and is now spoken as a first or second language in many countries of the world, many of which have developed one or more "national standards" (though this does not refer to published standards documents, but to frequency of consistent usage). English is the first language of the majority of the population in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, the Bahamas and Barbados and is an official language in many others, including India, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa and Nigeria; each country has a standard English with a grammar, spelling and pronunciation particular to the local culture.As the result of colonisation and historical migrations of English-speaking populations, and the predominant use of English as the international language of trade and commerce (a lingua franca), English has also become the most widely used second language.[8] Countries in which English is neither indigenous nor widely spoken as an additional language may import a variety of English via instructional materials (typically English English or North American English) and thus considered it "standard" for teaching and assessment purposes.[9] Typically, British English is taught as standard across Europe, the Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia, and American English is taught as standard across Latin America and East Asia. This does, however, vary between regions and individual teachers. In some areas a pidgin or creole language blends English with one or more native languages.GrammarMain article: English grammarAlthough the standard Englishes of the anglophone countries are similar, there are minor grammatical differences and divergences of vocabulary among the varieties. In American and Australian English, for example, "sunk" and "shrunk" as past-tense forms of "sink" and "shrink" are acceptable as standard forms, whereas standard British English retains the past-tense forms of "sank" and "shrank".[10] In Afrikaner South African English, the deletion of verbal complements is becoming common. This phenomenon sees the objects of transitive verbs being omitted: "Did you get?", "You can put in the box".[11] This kind of construction is infrequent in most other standardized varieties of English.The Origins of Standard EnglishIn the past, different scholars have meant different things by the phrase ‘Standard English’, when describing its emergence in medieval and early modern England. In the nineteenth century it tended to be used in relation to the wordstock.  Nineteenth-century scholars Earle[12] and Kington-Oliphant[13] conceived of the standardisation of English in terms of ratios of Romance to Germanic vocabulary.  Earle claimed that the works of the poets Gower and Chaucer, for instance, were written in what he called ‘standard language’ because of their amounts of French-derived vocabulary.Subsequently, attention shifted to the regional distribution of phonemes.  Morsbach,[14] Heuser[15] and Ekwall[16] conceived of standardisation largely as relating to sound-change, especially as indicated by spellings for vowels in stressed syllables, with a lesser emphasis on morphology.Mid-twentieth-century scholars McIntosh and Samuels[17] continued to focus on the distribution of spelling practice but as primary artefa
